# 📜 History of C Programming Language

## 🧠 Introduction

The **C programming language** is one of the most influential and widely used programming languages of all time. Developed in the early 1970s, C has served as the foundation for many modern languages such as C++, C#, Java, Objective-C, and even influenced Python and Go.

## 🏁 The Origins: 1960s – The Predecessors

### ➤ ALGOL (1958)
- **ALGOL (Algorithmic Language)** was developed in the late 1950s.
- It influenced many later languages, including C.
- Introduced concepts like code blocks and the begin/end pairs.

### ➤ CPL (1963)
- **Combined Programming Language (CPL)** was created to be more powerful than ALGOL.
- It was complex and hard to implement.

### ➤ BCPL (1966)
- Developed by **Martin Richards** at the University of Cambridge.
- A simplified version of CPL.
- Portable and used for writing compilers.

### ➤ B Language (1969–70)
- Created by **Ken Thompson** at Bell Labs.
- A simplified version of BCPL.
- Used primarily on the **DEC PDP-7**.
- Lacked data types and was slow for system programming.

## 🧱 Birth of C: 1972

### 👨‍💻 Dennis Ritchie and Bell Labs
- **Dennis Ritchie**, working at **Bell Labs**, developed C in **1972**.
- It was created to improve the B language and develop the **UNIX operating system**.
- The first version of C was used on a **DEC PDP-11**.

### 💡 Key Goals of C:
- Close to hardware for system programming.
- Structured and efficient for application-level development.
- Portable across systems.

## 📈 Evolution of C

### 🏗️ Early Versions (1972–1977)
- C was used to rewrite the UNIX operating system.
- Improved portability and maintainability of UNIX.

### 📘 K&R C (1978)
- **"The C Programming Language"** by **Brian Kernighan** and **Dennis Ritchie** was published.
- Also known as **K&R C**, this book served as the **de facto standard** of C.
- Introduced:
  - Functions
  - Pointers
  - Structures
  - Standard I/O functions

### 📜 ANSI C (C89/C90)
- **Standardized by ANSI** (American National Standards Institute) in **1989**.
- Known as **C89** or **ANSI C**.
- Adopted by **ISO in 1990** (as **C90**).
- Added:
  - Function prototypes
  - `const` and `volatile` keywords
  - Improved type safety

## 🌍 International Standardization

### 📆 ISO C (1990)
- C became an international standard under **ISO/IEC 9899:1990**.
- Ensured compatibility and portability across compilers and platforms.

### 🚀 C95
- A minor revision released in **1995** (ISO/IEC 9899:1995).
- Fixed defects and improved portability for embedded systems.

### 🧪 C99
- Released in **1999** (ISO/IEC 9899:1999).
- Introduced many features:
  - `inline` functions
  - Variable Length Arrays (VLAs)
  - `long long` type
  - New library functions
  - `//` single-line comments

### 🔧 C11
- Published in **2011** (ISO/IEC 9899:2011).
- Modernized C with:
  - Multithreading support (`<threads.h>`)
  - Unicode support (`char16_t`, `char32_t`)
  - Bounds-checking interfaces
  - Improved safety and performance

### 🌐 C17
- Published in **2017** (ISO/IEC 9899:2018).
- Bug fixes and clarifications.
- No major new features.

### 🔮 C23
- Approved in **2023**, with modern language improvements:
  - Improved UTF-8 support
  - New standard libraries
  - Easier interoperability with C++

## 🛠️ C in System Programming

- **UNIX** was the first major operating system written in C.
- **Linux**, **Windows kernel**, and many embedded systems use C extensively.
- Languages like **Python**, **Ruby**, and **PHP** are written in C.
- Compilers (GCC, Clang), databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL), and network tools (OpenSSL, Git) are C-based.
