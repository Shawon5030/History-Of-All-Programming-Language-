# üìú History of C Programming Language

## üß† Introduction

The **C programming language** is one of the most influential and widely used programming languages of all time. Developed in the early 1970s, C has served as the foundation for many modern languages such as C++, C#, Java, Objective-C, and even influenced Python and Go.

## üèÅ The Origins: 1960s ‚Äì The Predecessors

### ‚û§ ALGOL (1958)
- **ALGOL (Algorithmic Language)** was developed in the late 1950s.
- It influenced many later languages, including C.
- Introduced concepts like code blocks and the begin/end pairs.

### ‚û§ CPL (1963)
- **Combined Programming Language (CPL)** was created to be more powerful than ALGOL.
- It was complex and hard to implement.

### ‚û§ BCPL (1966)
- Developed by **Martin Richards** at the University of Cambridge.
- A simplified version of CPL.
- Portable and used for writing compilers.

### ‚û§ B Language (1969‚Äì70)
- Created by **Ken Thompson** at Bell Labs.
- A simplified version of BCPL.
- Used primarily on the **DEC PDP-7**.
- Lacked data types and was slow for system programming.
