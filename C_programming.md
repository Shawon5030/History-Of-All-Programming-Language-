# 📜 History of C Programming Language

## 🧠 Introduction

The **C programming language** is one of the most influential and widely used programming languages of all time. Developed in the early 1970s, C has served as the foundation for many modern languages such as C++, C#, Java, Objective-C, and even influenced Python and Go.

## 🏁 The Origins: 1960s – The Predecessors

### ➤ ALGOL (1958)
- **ALGOL (Algorithmic Language)** was developed in the late 1950s.
- It influenced many later languages, including C.
- Introduced concepts like code blocks and the begin/end pairs.

### ➤ CPL (1963)
- **Combined Programming Language (CPL)** was created to be more powerful than ALGOL.
- It was complex and hard to implement.

### ➤ BCPL (1966)
- Developed by **Martin Richards** at the University of Cambridge.
- A simplified version of CPL.
- Portable and used for writing compilers.

### ➤ B Language (1969–70)
- Created by **Ken Thompson** at Bell Labs.
- A simplified version of BCPL.
- Used primarily on the **DEC PDP-7**.
- Lacked data types and was slow for system programming.

## 🧱 Birth of C: 1972

### 👨‍💻 Dennis Ritchie and Bell Labs
- **Dennis Ritchie**, working at **Bell Labs**, developed C in **1972**.
- It was created to improve the B language and develop the **UNIX operating system**.
- The first version of C was used on a **DEC PDP-11**.

### 💡 Key Goals of C:
- Close to hardware for system programming.
- Structured and efficient for application-level development.
- Portable across systems.
