PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used, open-source, general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML.

Originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, PHP has evolved into a powerful tool for creating dynamic and interactive websites. Unlike frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, PHP runs on the server-side. This means that it executes on the server and sends only the output (usually HTML) to the user's web browser.
