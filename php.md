## 📜 Introduction

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used, open-source, general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML.

Originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, PHP has evolved into a powerful tool for creating dynamic and interactive websites. Unlike frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, PHP runs on the server-side. This means that it executes on the server and sends only the output (usually HTML) to the user's web browser.

### 🌍 Why Learn PHP?

PHP powers **over 75%** of websites that use server-side programming. Some of the most popular platforms and content management systems, such as **WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, Magento, and Laravel**, are either written in or heavily rely on PHP.

### 🧩 Key Features of PHP

- ✅ **Open Source:** Free to download and use.
- ⚡ **Fast Execution:** Interpreted quickly and optimized for web applications.
- 💡 **Easy to Learn:** Simple syntax similar to C and Perl.
- 🔗 **Cross-Platform:** Works on Windows, Linux, macOS, and other systems.
- 🌐 **Database Integration:** Excellent support for databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.
- 🧰 **Rich Library Support:** Offers thousands of built-in functions.
- 🔒 **Security:** Provides tools and practices to build secure web apps.

### 🔍 What Can PHP Do?

PHP is capable of performing a wide variety of tasks, including:

- Generating dynamic page content
- Collecting form data
- Sending and receiving cookies
- Performing server-side file manipulation (create, open, read, write)
- Managing sessions
- Interacting with databases
- Creating full-scale web applications
- Accessing and processing REST APIs
- Building CMS and eCommerce platforms

### 🖥️ PHP in Action

PHP is most commonly embedded directly into HTML files. Here's a very simple PHP example:

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First PHP Page</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>The current date and time is: <?php echo date("Y-m-d H:i:s"); ?></p>

</body>
</html>
