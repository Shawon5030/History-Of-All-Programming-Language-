## 📜 Introduction

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used, open-source, general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML.

Originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, PHP has evolved into a powerful tool for creating dynamic and interactive websites. Unlike frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, PHP runs on the server-side. This means that it executes on the server and sends only the output (usually HTML) to the user's web browser.

### 🌍 Why Learn PHP?

PHP powers **over 75%** of websites that use server-side programming. Some of the most popular platforms and content management systems, such as **WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, Magento, and Laravel**, are either written in or heavily rely on PHP.

### 🧩 Key Features of PHP

- ✅ **Open Source:** Free to download and use.
- ⚡ **Fast Execution:** Interpreted quickly and optimized for web applications.
- 💡 **Easy to Learn:** Simple syntax similar to C and Perl.
- 🔗 **Cross-Platform:** Works on Windows, Linux, macOS, and other systems.
